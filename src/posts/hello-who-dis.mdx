<p className="text-sm text-white/20">(I believe I've tried to start a blog more often than I've actually written blog posts lol)</p>

Welcome to my bland white-on-black corner of the internet, where i will be sharing my thoughts on an irregular basis.
I don't know what I will be writing on this blog yet, but here's a rundown of topics and ideas that could show up:

- tech (focus on programming, cuz duh)
- gaming
- anime
- news recaps

while very few points, all of them can be expanded on a bit, but im lazy, and I should be enjoying christmas instead of writing this.

Peace :)
