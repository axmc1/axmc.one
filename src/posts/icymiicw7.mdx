I did miss it last week, I was scarse on news and was very busy with other stuff. To not skip it again, here's a short

## Open source is not about you

In an older post/gist of [Rich Hickey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Hickey), creator of Clojure, they talk
about how a user of an open source software isn't entitled to anything. Saying <q>If you have expectations 
(of others) that aren't being met, those expectations are your own responsibility. You are responsible for your
own needs. If you want things, make them.</q>

It's a lovely short read, [check it out](https://gist.github.com/richhickey/1563cddea1002958f96e7ba9519972d9) :)

## Discord Age Verification

Following the steps of many governments locking down social media behind ID verifications, Discord is now also
requiring a face scan or ID for full access.

After a lot of backlash on social media, Discord clarified that <q>For most adults, age verification won't 
be required</q>, as they had enough data to determine most users' age. Not being verified as an adult will restrict
you from accessing age-restricted servers and channels, and you won't be able to speak in stage channels, along
with some warnings meant for teens.

Not happy with this change, many users started moving off Discord. So many, that TeamSpeak's hosting capacity
has been reached in many regions.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">With the incredible surge of new users joining TeamSpeak and subscribing to communities, current hosting capacity has been reached in many regions, especially in the United States.

## AI is solving the wrong problem

Bicameral put the stats together if AI is effective in production, and the numbers are not too surprising. Teams are
more productive, developers were 20% slower, and around half of AI code is vulnerable. They also go in on why we
aren't more productive with AI and what problem AI needs to be solving.

Been a bit busy recently, I haven't had much time to read news, stupidly enough. I do like this bi-weekly pattern,
I'll sleep on it a couple nights. I have been messing around with AI more often, and would enjoy sharing my experiences
here, especially if I'd like to help others with their AI choices as well.

see ya next week :)
