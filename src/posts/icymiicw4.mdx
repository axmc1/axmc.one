## NVIDIA sourcing from Anna's Archive

NVIDIA, while profiting the most from the AI bubble by selling chips, also makes their own models. Respectively,
they've been under legal trouble from copyright holders because of their training methods. NVIDIA defended it's actions
as fair use. Not only did that not help the allegations, move evidence was found during discovery.

Newly cited internal NVIDIA emails and documents allege that <q>competitive pressures drove NVIDIA to piracy</q>,
more accurately, Anna's Archive (AA). Although AA warned about the illegal nature of the library, NVIDIA execs gave
the green light within a week.

For more information on the topic, read [TorrentFreak's post](https://torrentfreak.com/nvidia-contacted-annas-archive-to-secure-access-to-millions-of-pirated-books/).

Some believe that Apple will announce new or updated products. This theory is led by some changes done in the Apple
website around the same time. The big talks of town are MacBook Pros with M5 Pro and Max chips and Airs with base M5
chips respectively.
Others believe it's a simple Creator Studio event, aligning with it's release date and considering only select creators
have been invited, no (known) journalists.

## 80% of european workers commit time theft

In a Digitec post done with results of a survey, we can see which nations commit the most time theft,
what they do during that time, the age ranges of the offenders, where they do it, and if they feel guilty about it.

Per the survey, Germany has the fewest working time thieves, while younger people are most likely to be involved in
time theft. For more information on such stats and more, read [Tobias' post at Digitec](https://www.digitec.ch/en/page/80-per-cent-of-europes-homeworkers-commit-time-theft-41150)

## Future of work with Dan Koe

Dan Koe wrote an article titled "The future of work when work is meaningless" explaining how work evolved during the

It's a long article, and it's worth every second of it, [check it out](https://letters.thedankoe.com/p/the-future-of-work-when-work-is-meaningless)

## Backlog

While this list won't be here every week, I'll always share what didn't make a cut.

Writing these posts has been a weird feeling recently, since I always have the post I'm sourcing from open on the side,
why would I write about it, if I can just link it? Sure, not everybody wants to read it all, but they can just scroll and skim
through it and collect what they deem neccessary. I'll announce any changes soon enough if anything would change. But
right now, I'm just gonna enjoy the rest of my weekend :)

See ya next week
