I don't even know how to start this. **Happy New Year!!**, that's a given. What a brutal start to the year, makes me feel like the captain from tintin in that one meme.

## AI causes TailwindCSS layoffs

In a [GitHub PR](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com/pull/2388) that adds the LLM-known /llms.txt endpoint to tailwindcss.com,
Adam Wathan, Creator of TailwindCSS, revealed the huge impact that AI had on TailwindLabs' business and the engineering team behind TailwindCSS.
In short: 

<q>Traffic to our docs is down about 40% from early 2023 despite Tailwind being more popular than ever.
The docs are the only way people find out about our commercial products, and without customers we can't afford to maintain the framework. [...]
Tailwind is growing faster than it ever has and is bigger than it ever has been, and our revenue is down close to 80%.</q>

Later Adam also posted a new episode on his podcast "Adam's Morning Walk" titled "[We had six months left](https://adams-morning-walk.transistor.fm/episodes/we-had-six-months-left)",
sharing more details about the situation.

- <q>If nothing changed at all, [...] in about 6 months we would no longer be able to meet payroll obligations</q>
- <q>We had to make the decision to scale down to something the business actually can afford. Because if we didn't do it now, then we would not be able to give people generous severance packages</q>
- <q>Every second that I spend reviewing a PR to add LLM documentation is a second I don't spend trying to turn around revenue at the company. [...] And this feature actually has a risk of decreasing revenue even more.</q>

If you're interested in the thoughts of Adam during this situation, I'd recommend you listen to the episode.

## StackOverflow back to day 1 traffic

A [Stack Exchange Data Explorer query](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/1926661#graph) that counts the number of questions posted each month on StackOverflow
has gained attraction, after showing the decline of the platform.

In November 2025, 4356 questions were asked on StackOverflow, only around 600 more than in August 2008, the month it was created, pointing out even more, how low traffic is.
Users on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46482345) expressed concern about the "downfall" of StackOverflow, pointing out its trustability in the answers it provides, unlike the newer AI-models.

## Auditing GitHub users' SSH key quality

In 2015, Benjojo collected and analyzed 1.3 million public SSH keys from GitHub users.
While also analyzing how many users didn't have keys and what key types were used the most, they also went down "scary lane", looking for weak keys and even comparing the keys to the Debian OpenSSH bug set of keys.
In the process, Benjojo gained access to some users' accounts that had commit access to large repos like Spotify and Yandex.

## Grok's deepfakes on Twitter (now X)

xAI's Grok went off the rails during the Christmas holidays, after users tagged the AI bot and asked it to modify images posted by users on Twitter. Those requests could range from putting burqas on people, to undressing them.

</figure>
      
In response to the obvious backlash this caused, Twitter limited image generation in the comments to paid users of the platform. Image generation is still free when using the Grok app.
Governments like the UK government are considering banning Twitter altogether after this incident. Elon Musk's answer to this is that the "UK wants to suppress free speech".
