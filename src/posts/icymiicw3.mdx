This week was a bit scary, I was a bit scarse on news, but OpenAI and HackerNews came in clutch to give me some extra content to write about :D

In this week's icymmicw <p className='text-xs'>(this line was also in last week's post, i forgot to get rid of it, now its sticking with us)</p>

## Ads in ChatGPT

In a Twitter post on Friday, OpenAI announced that they are testing ads in ChatGPT's free and Go plans.
Long story short, they claim that

- ads will not influence responses
- ads will be separate from responses and be labeled
- conversations are private from advertisers

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" data-theme="dark"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">In the coming weeks, we plan to start testing ads in ChatGPT free and Go tiers.  <br /> <br />We're sharing our principles early on how we'll approach ads-guided by putting user trust and transparency first as we work to make AI accessible to everyone.  <br />What matters most: <br />- Responses in… <a href="https://t.co/3UQJsdriYR">pic.twitter.com/3UQJsdriYR</a></p>&mdash; OpenAI (@OpenAI) <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/2012223373489614951?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2026</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Apple Intelligence is Gemini?

Apple Intelligence came and went. Center of attention during WWDC24. Unknown in WWDC25. But speak of the devil, we got some more news.

The long awaited "Siri 2.0" is going to be powered by Google's Gemini. In a [joint statement](https://blog.google/company-news/inside-google/company-announcements/joint-statement-google-apple/),
Apple says that they <q>determined that Google's Al technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models</q> and that <q>Apple Intelligence will continue to run on Apple devices and Private Cloud Compute</q>.
It is reported that Apple is paying Google 1 billion USD a year for this deal.

## Mozilla's open source AI strategy

In a blog post, Mozilla talks AI and how they plan on shaping it in 2026. They argue that AI is becoming a new intermediary, something the blog writer named "Layer 8" or an "agentic layer"
Their issue is that currently, it's a system we rent (closed systems) rather than own (open systems), concentrating power in a few companies. They aim to make open-source AI a viable alternative.

Mozilla says that closed AI systems dominate because they're easy to use and that open-source AI is fragmented and hard to integrate, and that the main barrier is developer experience. They intend to:
- Build an easier open AI stack
- Launch the [Mozilla Data Collective](https://datacollective.mozillafoundation.org/) to created licensed data sources
- Work with governments and enterprises deploying sovereign, auditable AI systems
- Invest in the ecosystem

## WhisperPair

Google Fast Pair (GFP) is a standard allowing bluetooth devices to "magically" connect to android devices using BLE. While (basically) every pair of headphones and earbuds support it,
not all manufacturers implement it correctly, forgetting to ignore GFP messages when the device is not in pairing mode, allowing an attacker to hijack the device, while already in use.

While a user's ear safety is a priority, the bigger issue stems from using a pair of headphones, that aren't registered to a Google account. This allows a hacker to register the headphones
as their own device and use Google's Find Hub Network (similar to Apple's Find My) to track the actual user of the headphones.

To check if you are vulnerable you can visit WhisperPair's [official site](https://whisperpair.eu/). Also, I heard about this vulnerability from Seytonic on YouTube, consider checking out his [video on the topic and more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ux07J-wS2VA)

## Detroit: Become Human, and some random thoughts

I recently downloaded [Detroit: Become Human](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1222140/Detroit_Become_Human/) again, and next to the obvious fun it was, I realized the story plays in 2038, which isn't too far away. 
If the AI bubble doesn't burst until then, I could see a bunch of [1X NEOs](https://www.1x.tech/neo)
walking around town. I hope that's all the correlation there is to the game, because if it goes further than that, we might be in some trouble.

If you haven't played it yet, I'm jealous that you can enjoy this masterpiece, I'd have my memory wiped to play this game again.
